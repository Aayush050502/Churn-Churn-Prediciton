# <div align="center">Telecom Customer Churn Prediction</div>



## What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn refers to the discontinuation of business with a firm or service by customers or subscribers.

In the telecommunications industry, customers have the flexibility to select from various service providers and frequently switch between them. The sector experiences an annual churn rate ranging between 15-25% due to intense competition.

Implementing personalized customer retention strategies poses a challenge as firms typically manage a large customer base and cannot allocate significant resources to each individual. The associated costs often outweigh the potential revenue gains. However, identifying customers likely to churn in advance enables companies to concentrate their retention efforts on these "high-risk" clients, aiming to expand coverage and enhance customer loyalty. The crux of success in this market lies within the customer base itself.

Customer churn stands out as a crucial metric since retaining existing customers proves to be more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

To proactively detect signs of potential churn, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive understanding of customers and their interactions across various channels. Addressing churn not only helps businesses maintain their market position but also fosters growth and prosperity. With an expanded customer network, the initial costs decrease while profits increase. Thus, the primary focus for a company's success lies in reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategies.
